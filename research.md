**Infrastructure Investment as a Dynamic Discrete Choice: Evidence from Kentucky Water Systems (JMP)**
>I study the ability of utility managers to maintain properly functioning infrastructure through investment. Using a newly collected dataset, I establish that proactive investment, completed in advance of infrastructure failures, and reactive investment are different and have separate effects. I incorporate this distinction into a dynamic discrete choice model of utility manager infrastructure investment decisions. Through simulations, I determine that water infrastructure investment levels are currently too low to successfully mitigate the decline of infrastructure quality. The results reveal that the difference in project types is important for designing policies to prevent widespread infrastructure decline. In this setting, I find that proactive investments are more efficient—the same expenditure yields a larger quality improvement—but policies promoting reactive investment are more effective at maintaining quality at acceptable levels. This is because projects undertaken in response to infrastructure issues can be better targeted to high improvement areas.


**[The Evolution of Concentration and Markups in the United States Cement Industry](/papers/moss_cement_draft.pdf)** (with [Nathan Miller](http://www.nathanhmiller.org/), [Matthew Osborne](https://sites.google.com/site/matthewosborne/), and [Gloria Sheu](https://sites.google.com/site/gloriaysheu/))
> We examine local market concentration and markups in the United States cement industry over 1974-2016. We estimate a model in which buyers use a second-score auction to procure cement from spatially differentiated plants. The model matches aggregated outcomes in the data, and the implied transportation costs and shipping distances are consistent with external sources. We infer local market concentration and markups from the model. At the county-level, the average HHI rises from 1,890 to 2,800 during the sample period. Average markups increase modestly, but prices do not rise. We attribute these changes to a technological innovation— the precalciner kiln—that lowered marginal costs, increased plant-level capacities, and also contributed to an industry shakeout in which many plants closed.
