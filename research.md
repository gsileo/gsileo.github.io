**Proactive and Reactive Infrastructure Investment (JMP)**
>Properly functioning infrastructure is maintained through investment. Proactive investments prevent failures but require expenditures before quality deteriorates. Reactive investments accept some risk of failure but avoid unnecessary expenditure. I explore proactive and reactive investments in a newly collected dataset on Kentucky water systems. I establish that proactive and reactive investments differentially reduce the probability of a system failure, and that both utility managers and consumers are sensitive to system quality. I construct and estimate a dynamic discrete choice model of utility manager infrastructure investment decisions incorporating the empirical relationships and investment strategy intuition. Through simulations, I determine that investment levels are too low to successfully mitigate the decline of water infrastructure quality. Counterfactual policies that promote only proactive projects lead some systems to make unnecessary investments even as others become vulnerable to extreme quality decline. By contrast, policies that facilitate more effective reactive policies incorporate more equitable levels of risk, reduce overspending, and enable all systems to maintain system quality.


**[The Evolution of Concentration and Markups in the United States Cement Industry](/papers/moss_cement_draft.pdf)** (with [Nathan Miller](http://www.nathanhmiller.org/), [Matthew Osborne](https://sites.google.com/site/matthewosborne/), and [Gloria Sheu](https://sites.google.com/site/gloriaysheu/))
> We examine local market concentration and markups in the United States cement industry over 1974-2016. We estimate a model in which buyers use a second-score auction to procure cement from spatially differentiated plants. The model matches aggregated outcomes in the data, and the implied transportation costs and shipping distances are consistent with external sources. We infer local market concentration and markups from the model. At the county-level, the average HHI rises from 1,890 to 2,800 during the sample period. Average markups increase modestly, but prices do not rise. We attribute these changes to a technological innovation— the precalciner kiln—that lowered marginal costs, increased plant-level capacities, and also contributed to an industry shakeout in which many plants closed.
