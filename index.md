I am an Assistant Professor in the Economics Department at Temple University.

I research the industrial organization of public institutions - specifically, I apply methods from empirical industrial organization to settings in which governments and other public entities are key decision makers. My work in this area has looked at investment in the infrastructure of publicly-owned drinking water systems and the procurement process in the prison phone industry. I also use IO methods to answer broader questions of public policy, such as regulations on donor compensation for blood plasma and the relationship between new technologies and market power.
