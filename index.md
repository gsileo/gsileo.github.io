I am a PhD candidate in Economics at Georgetown University. My primary fields of interest are empirical industrial organization and public economics. My research focuses on the IO of public institutions, and applies IO tools to investigate government decision making.

I am currently on the job market and am available for interviews, including at the ASSA 2023 Annual Meeting on January 6-8, 2023.

My advisors are [Nathan Miller](http://www.nathanhmiller.org/) and [John Rust](https://editorialexpress.com/jrust/).
