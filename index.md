I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Economics at Temple University.

My research interests include the industrial organization of public institutions and policy-relevant analysis. I have applied empirical industrial organization methods to a variety of topics including: drinking water infrastructure investment, prices in the prison phone industry, and technology and market power in the cement industry.
